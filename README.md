# hierarchy-server

The Scala server for a Trello-like task manager, but with trees and graphs to help me plan my life better.  
This project is currently in active development.

## to-do
- Dockerize
- Add option to API to support detailed vs non-detailed nodes
- Endpoint that flattens graph so that it can be displayed as cards in columns
